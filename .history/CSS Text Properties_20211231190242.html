    <h1>CuttleFish</h1>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also
        includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for
        control of buoyancy.

    <p>
        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with which
        they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, Sepia
        apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3
