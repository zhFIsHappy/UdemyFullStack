    <h1>CuttleFish</h1>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also
        includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for
        control of buoyancy.

        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with which
        they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, Sepia
        apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3

        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include
        dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2
        years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have
        one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <p>
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an unusual
        biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean,
        as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the time the family evolved,
        ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these warm-water species to
        cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although
        populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide line and
        the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category of
        "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means that while some over-exploitation of the marine
        animal has occurred in some regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them
        from being too threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into
        the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[13]
